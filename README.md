 Problem Statement and Soln we are Providing:
 
 
 This project primarily targets to all those students who have their JEE exam passed. After JOSAA counseling(in futer for all college but now it for jee only), they have no sources which are trustworthy which they can blindly rely on and would aid them to persist their journey. The critical point which might prove to be a turning point in their career is the college era because the college degree serves as a path to their bright future. They can either create or ruin their future which entirely depends upon the choice they make for themselves. The prodigies suffer a lot due to this because they have so bright minds which might get wasted due to a certain wrong decision. They try their level best to connect with the seniors of various colleges via various social networking sites but some seniors aren't even on certain sites which prove to be  fatal for their future decisions. Some seniors unintentionally due to certain works and personal reasons are unable to reply at the right time.
The naive mass fall into certain influences going by certain statistics but  the seniors are the ones who can enlighten us about the latent facts of the institution.



Solution:
So to get rid of all this problems, we have got you covered. We have designed an application which includes various functionalities. For  instances it has a database of numerous years like second and third years. The upcoming first year students can directly  come in contact which will clarify their queries easily and give them the correct peice of advice before opting for colleges. It also covers information brochures regarding scholarships and clubs which will grow their interests towards a respective college. And as soon as they'll start using our app on a regular basis,so we will start monetising these advices starting from a lower amount to a good amount. This application is the need of the hour today because after the COVID times, we all have faced dire repercussions in some way or the  other so why don't we save our future stakeholders from facing the same.


Additional courses will also be provided
by our app like DSA,and web development so that they can utilise their free time in building their skills and groom them to make them stand in the cut throttle competitive world. Programming is a must for grabbing better job opportunities that they'll get studying their core fields. 

Counsellers are also an additional perk that our application provides to help our customers in making the most  righteous choice and help in building their future bright. 
Information regarding various clubs which participate in various competitions and guide them to choose  their college of dream wisely.
The most critical point in everyone's career is their transition from a school going lad to a college going adult and a responsible contributer towards their country's development.


So this app acts as a medium in bridging their gap between their JOSAA counseling and College life.
