## Problem Statement and Solution:

After the JOSAA counseling process, students often struggle to make informed decisions about their college choices. Our application aims to bridge this gap by providing students with reliable information and advice from seniors and counselors. Here's how our solution addresses the problem:

### Solution Highlights:

- **Senior Interaction**: Connects upcoming first-year students directly with seniors to clarify queries and receive valuable advice about colleges.
- **Information Brochures**: Provides information about scholarships, clubs, and additional courses to pique students' interests.
- **Monetization Strategy**: Offers a platform to monetize advice and guidance, incentivizing seniors to provide accurate and timely information.
- **Additional Courses**: Offers courses in DSA and web development to help students enhance their skills and seize better job opportunities.
- **Counseling Services**: Provides counseling services to assist students in making informed decisions and shaping their futures.
- **Bridging Gap**: Acts as a medium between JOSAA counseling and college life, easing the transition for students.
